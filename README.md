This notebook models an LSTM recurrent neural network with the goal of predicting whether a jet engine will fail. 
Sequential sensor data is provided in a simulated training dataset containing data for 100 jet engines.  A separate file contains the test data and the test data labels. 

The goal was to experiment and learn how to model using LSTM. 

Tools: Python, Visual Studio Code, GitHub
